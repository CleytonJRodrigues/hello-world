"HELLO WORLD"
That is purely a test. A simple common habit for newcoming, to be programmers.

You know, my first "Hello-World", written in C language, did not work.
A lad said it could be a sign, that i am doomed in programming, things aren't going to work its way out.
I don't think so. At least, I HOPE.

Oh Well...
